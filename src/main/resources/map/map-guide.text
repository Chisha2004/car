An entity is something that can fill up 1 or many tiles based on its width x height
ENTITY_NAME=NumberOfTilesxWise x NumberOfTilesHeightWise eg. NONE=1x1 will result in no entity being placed here on a single slot,
NONE=2x1 means NONE(empty) tile being placed on the next 2 tiles or NONE=2x2 means place entity on 2 tiles via the x axis and 2 tiles via the y axis

When using a more than one title in a place the next, if that tile covers the lower corresponding tiles like in a 4x4 we need to leave those tiles with an empty
in the line where we would have added one since it is already occupied by the above 4x4. Validation will be done to ignore any pixel entity injection where
already filled by another entity
